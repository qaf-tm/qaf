## VER-2_0-b08 Release Notes

**New Features:**

* Added support localization of xml file. To create xml file for specific local provide local ext after .xml for example testdata.xml.en

* Added test step feature: 

**Step Feature:**

ISFW will provide a mechanism to specify any method as test step by annotating the method with @IsTestStep. Furthermore methods in class specified as step provider by annotating the class with@IsTestStepProvider. Also we have provided provision to supply step description so that it can be reported in report.
 
```java
public class SampleClass{

       @IsTestStep(description="do the needful with {0}")
       public static void testStep(String s) {
              System.out.println("testStep invoked!....." + s);
       }

      @IsTestStep(description="do the needful")
       public void testStep2() {
              System.out.println("testStep without args invoked!.....");
       }
}

@IsTestStepProvider
public class SampleStepProvider {
      public void step() {
              System.out.println("step invoked!.....");
       }
       public void anotherStep() {
              System.out.println("anotherStep invoked!.....");
       }
}
```

* Added Step client for Excel
 
**Bug Fixes:**

* Fixed issue of overriding resources from config file by providing resource file(s)/dir(s)

 
## VER-2_0-b07 Release Notes:

**New Features:**

* Json based reporting support , you need to copy dashboard.htm and jquery directory.

* Added service entry to register testNG listener. Now you don't require to register testng listener of ISFW. Please remove "com.qmetry.qaf.automation.testng.IsTestNGListener" entry from the listener entries in existing build files.

* Added support to directly provide remote webdriver url in case it is not in standard remote webdriver format. ie http://<host>:<port>/wd/hub. In case the remote wd url is different then the defult pattern then insted of providing server and port just provide actual url as value of server property. For example: http://14.97.73.4:7777/wd/

* Added support/compatibility with selenium 2.25 and later for using running browser session


**Bug Fixes:**

* Fixed issue of finding element within component.

 
## VER-2_0-b06 Release Notes

**New Features:**

* Added String matcher and additional wait/assert/verify methods for element text and value with String matcher argument

**example:**

```java
 import static com.qmetry.qaf.automation.util.StringMatcher.containsIgnoringCase
 ele.verifyText(containsIgnoringCase("partial text"));
 ele.verifyText(exact("text"));
 ele.verifyText(startsWith("prefix"));
 ele.verifyText(startsWithIgnoringCase("prefix"));
 ele.verifyText(like("valid regular expr"));
 ele.verifyText(likeIgnoringCase("valid regular expr"));
```
 
 {% include note.html content='ele.verifyText("text") is equivalent to ele.verifyText(exactIgnoringCase ("text"))' %}
   
* Added Support to provide wait time for wait methods.
	
**example:**

```java
 ele.waitForText(containsIgnoringCase("partial text")); //default timeout and interval
 ele.waitForText(containsIgnoringCase("partial text"),5000); //with timeout 5000 ms and default interval 
 ele.waitForText(containsIgnoringCase("partial text"),5000,100); //with timeout 5000 ms and interval 100ms
```

* Added support for xml data provider

```java
 @IsDataProvider(key = "test.set")
 @Test
 public void xmlDPTest(String p1, String p2, String p3) {
  System.out.printf("data - p1:[%s] p2:[%s] p3:[%s]", p1, p2, p3);
 }
 
 @IsDataProvider(key = "test.set")
 @Test
 public void xmlDPTest(Map<String, String> data) {
  System.out.println("data - " + data);
 }
```

below is the content of data file

```xml 
<testdata>
  <test>
    <set>
      <val1>aaa</val1>
      <val2>bbb</val2>
      <val3>ccc</val3>
    </set>
    <set>
      <val1>xxx</val1>
      <val2>yyy</val2>
      <val3>zzz</val3>
    </set>
    <set>
      <val1>111</val1>
      <val2>222</val2>
      <val3>333</val3>
    </set>
  </test>
</testdata>  
```      
* Added support for xml property configuration

* Added locale support

  Any locale or env specific data can be stored in properties file with extension of the locale or env. It can be retrieved by getting subset.
  We need to specify which locales we want to initialize by setting following property   
  #all the locales that can be used
  
  ```properties
  load.locales= zh_CN;hi
  ```
  
  above setting will load properties from *.zh_CN *.hi files
  
  To access hi locale properties

```java
 ConfigurationManager.getBundle().subset("hi").getString("test.prop");
 props.subset("hi").getString("test.prop");
 props.subset("zh_CN").getString("test.prop");
```

There is a provision of setting default locale by providing default.locale

In that case if multiple locale loaded and want to use prop from default locale then don't require to use subset.

**For example:**

```properties
 load.locales= zh_CN;hi
 default.locale= hi
```

Then use properties directly for hi locale: 

```java
props.getString("test.prop");
```

For zh_CN: 

```java
props.subset("zh_CN").getString("test.prop")
```


{% include note.html content=" in this case where 'hi' is set to default. props.subset('hi').getString('test.prop'); will not work as 'hi' locale is default locale so will be added to main configuration." %}

Default encoding for reading locale properties is UTF-8 that can be change by providing system/application property "locale.char.encoding"
 
* Added component class and support to find component from parent element.

```java
public class TestComponent extends Component {
 public TestComponent(String locator) {
 super(locator);
 } ....
 } 
 TestComponent comp = ele.findElement("css=a", TestComponent.class);
 List<TestComponent> testComponents =
 ele.findElements("css=.pass", TestComponent.class);
```

* Added support to link java doc with test description in report. To enable set property  'report.javadoc.link=true' to set docs dir path set property `javadoc.folderpath` default is `"../../../docs/tests/"` to customize link set `report.javadoc.link.format` default value is `<a href="%s" target="_blank">[View-doc]</a>`

* Added support to pass parameter in locator string.

**For exmple**

in locator xpath=//@*/[name()=' wl:trnslate'][.='${foo.bar}']//.. ${foo.bar} will be replaced with the value of property  "foo.bar". Assuming value is xxx then the locator will become xpath=//@*[name()='.. Same way link=${foo.bar} will become link=xxx
 
It supports multiple parameters as well as same parameter multiple times.

* Added QC support - refer QC integration doc

* Support for JSON file to provide test data. Test method should expect Map.

* Added support to use map as parameter for data-driven test where db is used to provide data. column name/alise will be key and column value will be value.

* Added support to use existing driver session

Following are the steps:

 1. Webdriver session can be created through http://localhost:4444/wd/hub/static/resource/hub.html. After starting session you can perform manual steps on the browser!
 2. You need to use only appropriate remote driver for this purpose. (e.g. firefoxRemoteDriver)
 3. You need to provide session id by setting driver extra capability  webdriver.remote.session  or a property  webdriver.remote.session . The session id can
            &lt;driver&gt;.extra.capabilities=webdriver.remote.session=&lt;session id&gt; or
            webdriver.remote.session=&lt;session id&gt;
 
Introduced page launch strategy so that one can define the page launch behavior from one of the following

  * always launch from parent
  * always launch from root
  * launch page only if required (default)         
  * Added support for retry command through command tracker so that in on failure we can set retry to true and give it to one more try.
  * Added support for self-descriptive web element:
  
            For self descriptive locator you can provide json string with key "desc".
            See below example of normal and self descriptive element locator.

```java
 String LOGOUT_LINK_LOC = "{'locator':'link=Logout','desc'='Logout link'}";
 String LOGOUT_LINK_LOC ="{'locator':'key=loc.properyname.in.property.file','desc'='Logout link'}"; 
 //self descriptive
```

the element description is available by ele.getDescription().
Also it will be used in different assertion/verification messages automatically by the fw.

* Added support for fill string in given format for bean property.
	Added randomize parameter format which can be used to provide format of the value. It will work only with String properties of bean.

**Sample format**

  * 999-999-99
  * aaa-a9a-99
  * 99.99.aa
  
alphabet will replaced random alphabet and digit will replaced with random digit

* Added safari driver support. required selenium server 2.21 or latest

* Added support for Date property in data bean. Fill random data will generate random date for day range min-max to current date

* Added new FindBy Annotation so you can find element by selenium-1 locator strategy

* Added order parameter in UiElement annotation. This can be used to set order of bean properties for fillUiElement.

* Support to override any property using testng config or system property. Priority will be system property, xml config, property file.

* Additional flag "selenium.failure.screenshots" to skip screen-shot for each failure and to have single screen-shot in case of failure.

* Added support for providing extra capability through property.

	* For all driver set property "driver.extra.capabilities"
	* For specific driver set property "&lt;driver&gt;.extra.capabilities"
	
**Example:**

```properties
driver.extra.capabilities=acceptSslCerts=false;platform=WINDOWS
chrome.extra.capabilities=acceptSslCerts=true;chrome.switches=[--ignore-
certificate-errors] chrome.extra.capabilities=acceptSslCerts=true;chrome.switches=[-- 
ignore-certificate-errors, --sample-other-switch] -added support for otherDriver or
otherRemoteDriver
```

For that you must need to set property "other.extra.capabilities".
In case of otherDriver (not remote driver) you must need to provide driver class as capability : "driver.class",

**Example :**

```properties
other remote driver
other.extra.capabilities=platform=ANY;browserName=safari
other driver 
other.extra.capabilities=driver.class=org.openqa.selenium.safari.SafariDriver
```
 
* Added new form data bean and UiElement annotation

* Support to java script expr for dependent value match in form data bean

* Added support to use map as parameter for data-driven test, first row will be treated as header row header column will considered as key.

* Added support to populate bean from map having bean properties as keys

* Added skip parameter in Randomizer annotation

 
**Data bean random data generation:**
 
* Added support for min and max value 
 
**Improvements:**

* Updated properties util, derived from PropertiesConfiguration [dependency of commons-configuration.jar]

* Updated data-provider functionality

* Updated data driven functionality

	* added new annotation IsDataProvider 

	* added listener IsAnnotationTransformer

**Properties:**

For test data:
&lt;tc&gt;.testdata=&lt;param&gt;=value;&lt;param&gt;=value globle.
&lt;param&gt; are one of the parameter of IsDataProvider (dataFile, sheetName,hasHeaderRow,labelName,sqlQuery)

Discontinue to support property CMD_EXECUTION_INTERVAL (key:commands.execution.interval) to Set execution interval between two selenium commands.

**Bug Fixes:**

1. Fix for IllegalAccessException while filling random data in non public variables
2. Fixed issue of varification failed test considered as pass with testng 6.
